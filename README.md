# SourceryTemplates

This repository contains some templates (in the `Templates/` directory) to use for Code Generation in Swift with [Sourcery](http://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery).

You can see them in action by opening the `TemplatesDemo.xcodeproj` Xcode project: its `UnitTests` target contains some use case examples for each template, and some code using the generated code in each associated `XCTestCase`.

## Type Erasure

This template provides type erasure to any protocol you annotated accordingly.

### Usage

* Annotate the protocol to type-erase using `// sourcery: TypeErase = X` where `X` is the `associatedtype` to erase
* Use the template in [`Templates/TypeErase.stencil`](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SourceryTemplates/blob/master/Templates/TypeErase.stencil) with [Sourcery](http://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) to generate Type-Erased code for this annotated protocol(s)
* Add the generated `TypeErase.generated.swift` file to your Xcode project
* Profit!

### Examples

You can find some examples in the [`UnitTests/TypeErasure`](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SourceryTemplates/tree/master/UnitTests/TypeErasure) directory in this repo, like those:

```swift
// sourcery: TypeErase = PokemonType
protocol Pokemon {
  associatedtype PokemonType
  func attack(move: PokemonType)
}
```

```swift
// sourcery: TypeErase = Model
protocol Row {
  associatedtype Model

  var sizeLabelText: String { get set }

  func configure(model: Model)
}
```

You can look at the [file generated by Sourcery](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SourceryTemplates/blob/master/TypeErasure/UnitTests/Generated/TypeErase.generated.swift) from those examples using the provided [`Templates/TypeErase.stencil`](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SourceryTemplates/blob/master/Templates/TypeErase.stencil) template. Magic! ðŸŽ©âœ¨

### More Info

This is a first draft of the template, so please don't hesitate to improve it.

I haven't tested a lot of real-world use cases yet so some corner cases are probably missing but feel free to submit a PR to fix them!

The template generates the same code structure as the one explained in [this BigNerdRanch article](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/breaking-down-type-erasures-in-swift/) that inspired me to come up with a working template.

You can also find more information about Type-Erasure by watching [Gwendolyn's talk at Try! Swift](https://news.realm.io/news/tryswift-gwendolyn-weston-type-erasure/) â€” from which I borrowed the Pokemon examples to test that template.

## Other templates

* [Sourcery itself has some template examples](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/tree/master/Templates)
* You can also find a template by **@Liquidsoul** [on his own repo](https://github.com/Liquidsoul/Sourcery-AutoJSONSerializable) to auto-generate code for JSON serialization & deserialization.
